			//
			// Core AJAX handler
			//
			// We submit AJAX requests as POST (always) and examine the results to decide
			// what to do. There are several possibilities:
			//
			// 1. The request could time out.
			//
			//    The server might be offline, the internet connection might have broken,
			//    or the request is just taking too long. Show an error to the user,
			//    then invoke the failure handler on the AJAX request.
			//
			// 2. The server could return an error.
			//
			//    Such a response will not have a JSON-parseable body. It might be a
			//    server error (500) or a 400-range error; we should display an error to
			//    the user indicating such, then invoke the failure handler on the
			//    AJAX request.
			//
			//    NOTE: we will never directly receive a 301/302 response to an AJAX
			//    call. The browser will internally follow the redirect before we even
			//    see it. Therefore, responses which are intended to redirect the host
			//    page return a JSON-formatted response which we interpret below.
			//
			// 3. The server could return a successful response that does not parse as
			//    valid JSON.
			//
			//    This is a degenerate case and should never happen from our application
			//    code; however, we are human and mistakes happen. We treat this as a
			//    server error and display a response to the user, then invoke the failure
			//    handler on the AJAX request.
			//
			// 4. The server could return a JSON-parseable response. Hooray.
			//
			// 4a. The response indicates a host page redirect. Do it. (See note on #2.)
			//
			//     NOTE: we do not invoke EITHER the success or failure handlers on the
			//     AJAX request; we interpret this server-designated redirect as an
			//     instruction to completely dump JavaScript state and move to a new
			//     page without delay.
			//
			// 4b. The response indicates an exception.
			//
			//	   When the server is in a DEBUG configuration, exceptions will be
			//	   given with backtraces and these should be presented. Otherwise,
			//	   a generic message should be shown to the user as the server will
			//	   not be providing details.
			//
			//     Show the error to the user, then invoke the failure handler on the
			//     AJAX request.
			//
			// 4c. The response indicates a form validation error.
			//
			//     This should only happen on a form submission. Show the errors to the
			//     user and highlight the form fields appropriately, then invoke the
			//     failure handler on the AJAX request.
			//
			//     In some cases we might want to return a completely different error
			//     message to the user (like 4d, below) but still treat the result as
			//     a form error to retain its field highlighting and error popover
			//     capabilities. We thus also check for such a specific error message
			//     and, if present, show that in place of our generated-from-field-
			//     errors message.
			//
			//     NOTE: normally a failure handler is not needed in this case because
			//     we have already shown the error to the user. Only use the error
			//     handler if there is special processing that you need to do.
			//
			// 4d. The response indicates a processing error.
			//
			//     This indicates an expected error such as "login required" or
			//	   "permission denied". Some of these could certainly have been
			//	   implemented with HTTP response codes, but by handling them this
			//	   way we allow the server to return specific error text for the
			//	   request, rather than more generic text.
			//
			//     Show the error to the user, then invoke the failure handler on the
			//     AJAX request.
			//
			// 5.  The response indicates success. Double Hooray.
			//
			//     The server may indicate one OR MORE of the following successful
			//     responses:
			//
			// 5a. Request-specific data.
			//
			//     Since this is request/application-specific, if this kind of result
			//     is detected, we invoke the success handler immediately and do not
			//     do any further processing, even if HTML, modal, or toast results
			//     are present. This way, the application can easily disable the
			//     processing of these results.
			//
			// 5b. HTML results.
			//
			//     This is given as a list of element IDs and the HTML to overwrite
			//     their contents with. We automate this because it's such a common
			//     operation. The success handler is invoked, but not until modal
			//     or toast requests are processed.
			//
			// 5c. The response requires toast.
			//
			//     Toast is a modeless notice that typically pops up from the bottom
			//     of the browser window and disappears on its own after a set amount
			//     of time. It is ideal for short confirmation messages that do not
			//     require interrupting the user's task, such as when saves are
			//     incremental or the user is expected to immediately enter a new
			//     record. The success handler is invoked, but not until modal
			//     requests are processed.
			//
			//     NOTE: toast triggered by this mechanism cannot have any callbacks
			//     attached. If callbacks are required when toast is delivered or
			//     removed, return results and invoke toast from a success handler.
			//
			// 5d. The response requires a modal notice.
			//
			//     This visually looks similar to a processing error (case 4c) but
			//     it's treated as a successful response and there is an opportunity
			//     to style the modal differently. The success handler is invoked,
			//     but not until the modal is closed by the user.
			//
			//     NOTE: a successful form submission will usually not return any
			//     type 5 kind of response, but will instead return a 4a redirect
			//     response to take the user to a new page. However in some cases it
			//     may make sense to incrementally build a page while maintaining
			//     state in the user's session.
			//
			// 6.  The response, which is JSON-parseable, doesn't seem to have any of
			//     our required instructions.
			//
			//     This is a programming screw-up. Show an error to the user and invoke
			//     the failure handler on the AJAX request.
			//
			// TIMEOUT NOTE: the timer starts as soon as the AJAX request is queued,
			// but browsers will limit the number of simultaneous connections to a single
			// server and if a lot of AJAX requests are pending, a request may time out
			// on the client side before it is even submitted to the server. For this
			// reason we set the limit relatively high by default, longer than we would
			// comfortably use as a server setting.
			//
			// CALLBACK NOTE: in contrast to the jQuery success/failure callbacks, we
			// use a single parameter signature for these callbacks which allows you to
			// use the same function for each if you want. We pass:
			//
			//	callback(success, data, status, message, jqXHR)
			//
			//		success: false for ALL failure modes
			//		data: an object for success; for errors, may be an object or null
			//		status:
			// success will be true or false. data will be null on failure. message will
			// be null on success.
			//
			// RETURN VALUE NOTE: This call returns the jqXHR object which is derived
			// from Deferred, so you may be tempted to use the .done and .fail methods
			// to attach handlers. DO NOT DO THIS. "Success" and "failure" of the
			// underlying AJAX request is not sufficient, as many "success" modes are
			// still failures. Use the success and failure parameters instead. Later
			// we may refactor to return a Deferred object of our own. The primary
			// reason for returning the jqXHR is to allow upload progress monitoring.
			// This is now irrelevant as we do file upload monitoring internally.
			//
			// Zach Stevenson 7/10/2014  Added a flag to fail silently.  There are situations
			// like predictive search when you are doing abort() on the ajax object when you
			// don't want it to pop up a modal saying "You canceled the operation".
			// By marking this you know that you are risking possibly unexpected behaviour.

			// the URL

			// Django CSRF token (else our request will be denied)
			//
			// NOTE: we check for this by looking for an explicit http: or https prefix
			// on the request, on the assumption that ALL local requests will omit
			// this; if your AJAX requests are returned with 403, you might be making
			// a fully-qualified request which won't work (and is bad anyway because

			// origin policy.

		//
		//	success			called when file is successfully uploaded
		//	failure			called when file upload is cancelled or otherwise fails
		//	progress		called whenever file upload progress changes
		//	show_busy		whether to show the busy indicator
		//
		//	target_field_id	the ID (not the name) of the hidden field
		//	allow_multiple	whether multiple files are allowed; if not,
